## Sweet Shop Management System

# Project Overview
This is a full-stack web application for managing a sweet/candy shop, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The project features a modern, pastel-themed UI, persistent inventory management, and role-based access for users and admins.


## My AI Usage
This section documents my use of AI tools during the development of this project, as required by the assessment policy.

# AI Tool(s) Used:
GitHub Copilot
ChatGPT
Claude AI

# How I Used AI:
I used Copilot to scaffold out Express routes, MongoDB models, and vanilla JS modules for the frontend, which I then customized for my needs.
ChatGPT was invaluable for resolving backend errors (like CORS issues, JWT authentication bugs, and MongoDB connection problems) and for CSS layout fixes.
I asked ChatGPT for suggestions on modern pastel color schemes, responsive layouts, and accessibility improvements for the sweet shop interface.
Copilot helped me quickly draft RESTful endpoints and validation logic, which I reviewed and refined.
Best Practices: Both tools provided tips on security (password hashing, JWT), code organization, and error handling.


#My Reflection:
Using AI tools felt like having a knowledgeable coding partner available 24/7. They helped me move past blockers quickly, especially with tricky CSS and backend integration. The AI suggestions often introduced me to new patterns and best practices, making my code cleaner and more robust. Overall, AI accelerated my workflow, reduced frustration, and let me focus more on building features and polishing the user experience.
